**Note**: I do not encourage cheating whatsoever; this project was merely an intellectual exercise.

## Summary
The program moves the Wordament window into a specific location, screenshots each tile, performs OCR (via Tesseract/Tess4J), and then solves the board. Processing and solving the board takes about 10 seconds of calculation time before starting to input words into the game board.
